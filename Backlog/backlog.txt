Draw only one of two overlapping edges [20200126].
--------------------------------------------------
If both edges of overlapping edges are drawn then:
   o Extra time is used.
   o If transparancy is used, then the transparancy on the overlap will be
     different from other areas.
   o The order of drawing the edges can affect the result.
Remark 20200405: This is probably implemented by using the determinant.
